```

```bash
# Simply open the file
open index.html

# Or use a local server
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000/
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the repository Actions tab for deployment logs
2. Verify all files are committed and pushed
3. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled with correct settings
